- `'use server'` is the same as `import 'server-only'`
- `NextUI` is nuts
- `useFormState` and `useFormStatus`
- `Parallel Routes` - allows you to render one or more routes at the same time
- using `cookies()` force next to not cache the page
    - if you used `cache()` it would be cached even if you used `cookies()`
